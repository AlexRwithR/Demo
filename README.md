This is a small demonstration of my coding and sound analysis prowess. Here I showcase some of the custom functions I created to expedite the sound analysis process. The code here is only a small part of a larger project, as more is completed I will continue to add to this portfolio. This portfolio is organized so that each script has a designated duty; whether that be creating a function, downloading file, or analysis of the file.

In this demonstration I use a recording of an American Yellow Warblerâ€™s (Setophaga aestiva) song downloaded from xeno-canto. The code should automatically download the file. Credit goes to Peter Boesman (Peter Boesman, XC322837. Accessible at www.xeno-canto.org/322837)
